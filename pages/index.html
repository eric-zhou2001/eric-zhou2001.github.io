        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p class='content'>My name is Eric Zhou, and I am a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I graduated from the Commonwealth
            School, located in Boston, Massachusetts. I grew up in Lexington, Massachusetts (yes, the one from the Battle of Lexington and Concord!).</p>
        <p class='content'>Along with schoolwork, I have taken part in research (The Gilroy Lab), project teams (Coding For Good), and have taught introductory coding
            classes (Software Training for Students). I'm particularly interested in learning about bioinformatics and how computer science intersects with
            biology.</p>
        <p class='content'>In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with friends and family, and going on runs/hikes.</p>

                <h2>Pytutor</h2>
                <h4>A new, interactive way to submit homework.</h4>
                <p><Strong>Pytutor</Strong> is a program that a group and I are developing for introductory CS courses. We hope to create a new homework submission feature for 
                    students to use in place of other programs. We also hope to provide professors a new way to design homework assignments for students to use. Will be
                    used by CS220 (Introduction to Python Programming) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
                </p>
                <p>Programmed the backend using Python. Reads into and writes to HTML files/worksheets for professors to use depending on user input through a config file. 
                </p>
                <p>Built frontend pages (HTML + CSS) of the homepage and question pages during Hackathon (HackThis, Illinois). Added JavaScript functionality as well to the web pages so that
                   user input is stored in S3 bucket. Allows students to sort through questions, ask their own questions, and respond to each other. User inputted code is interactive as well
                   in the web page, programmed using the same script as the worksheet creator.
                </p>
                <p>Working on mobile app that will be downloadable through app store. Using HTML, CSS, Angular, and Ionic.</p>

                <p><Strong>runTracker</Strong> provides insight into your daily runs, combining open source data visualization tools as well as a database that stores your previous runs to 
                 view later. I wanted a new way of understanding my personal exercise goals, and wanted graphs and information of where I run and how often I run, as well as a log/list of how many 
                 times I ran.</p>
                <p>Clicking on the preview brings you to the github repository to see my code. Any feedback is welcome, and the README.md contains more information about the 
                 project's working state as well as future plans for the project.</p>
                <p>The frontend is constructed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery. The backend is made up of PHP and MySQL.</p>
