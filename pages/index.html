            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p class='content'>My name is Eric Zhou, and I am a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I graduated from the Commonwealth
                School, located in Boston, Massachusetts. I grew up in Lexington, Massachusetts (yes, the one from the Battle of Lexington and Concord!).</p>
            <p class='content'>Along with schoolwork, I have taken part in research (The Gilroy Lab), project teams (Coding For Good), and have taught introductory coding
                classes (Software Training for Students). I'm particularly interested in learning about bioinformatics and how computer science intersects with
                biology.</p>
            <p class='content'>In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with friends and family, and going on runs/hikes.</p>

                    <p><Strong>Pytutor</Strong> is a program that a group and I are developing for introductory CS courses. We hope to create a new homework submission feature for 
                        students to use in place of other programs. We also hope to provide professors a new way to design homework assignments for students to use. Will be
                        used by CS220 (Introduction to Python Programming) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
                    </p>
                    <p>Programmed the backend using Python. Reads into and writes to HTML files/worksheets for professors to use depending on user input through a config file.

                       how websites were formed. I plan to add some JavaScript animation/functionality as well as time goes on. The entirety of this website is located on my github
